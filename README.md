# HYDRO-NOWCAST | Urban Flood Nowcasting System

> **SIH 2026 Solution Design — Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) / NCMRWF**  
> Dynamic two-way coupled 1D/2D drainage-rainfall nowcasting platform with sub-street resolution and flood-safe emergency navigation.

## 🌊 Overview

**HYDRO-NOWCAST** is an advanced urban flood modeling and decision support platform engineered to predict street-level inundation during extreme convective precipitation events in real-time. By dynamically coupling radar-derived quantitative precipitation estimates with surface overland hydraulics and subsurface storm sewer networks, the system delivers actionable nowcasts and resilient routing paths before flash floods paralyze urban centers.

## 🚀 Key Modules & Capabilities

- **Module A: Radar Rainfall Nowcasting Engine**
  - Converts Doppler weather radar reflectivity (dBZ) into Quantitative Precipitation Estimates (QPE) using the Marshall-Palmer $Z = aR^b$ relationship.
  - Generates spatio-temporal rainfall grids across 15-minute lead-time intervals (T+15, T+30, T+45, T+60 min).

- **Module B: 2D Surface Overland Routing**
  - Cellular-automata diffusive-wave 2D overland routing accounting for micro-topography, surface slope, and land-use roughness (Manning's $n$).

- **Module C: 1D Subsurface Drainage Network Graph**
  - Network-graph hydraulic solver using Manning's equation for circular pipe conduit flow and gravitational energy slopes.
  - Accommodates siltation factors, pipe diameters, and manhole hydraulic heads.

- **Module D: Dynamic Two-Way Coupled Feedback Loop**
  - Continuous feedback between surface ponding and underground drainage:
    - *Under-capacity*: Storm grates intake runoff from streets into conduits.
    - *Over-capacity / Surcharge*: Pressurized pipes backflow water onto the street surface as fountain surcharge.

- **Module E: Flood-Safe Emergency Navigation API**
  - Dynamic cost-weighted A* routing algorithm prioritizing flood-free roads.
  - Automatically avoids inundated roads exceeding critical vehicle safety clearance thresholds (e.g., >0.2m for light vehicles, >0.5m for emergency response units).

- **Interactive GIS Command Center & Calibration Studio**
  - Real-time Leaflet GIS mapping with depth-classified color ramps.
  - Historical storm backtesting validation suite against recorded waterlogging logs.
  - ULB drain editor for real-time asset calibration, siltation adjustments, and pump station scenarios.
